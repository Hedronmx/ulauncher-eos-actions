A [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension to support [eOS](https://elementary.io/).

All actions are performed using [`dbus-send`](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-send.1.html).

Icons are part of the [elementary icons](https://github.com/elementary/icons).

This extension was inspired by [Exit Gnome](https://github.com/leinardi/ulauncher-exit-gnome).
